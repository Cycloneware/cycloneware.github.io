            <h2>CycloneWare Pausing Development on January 11th</h2>
            <p><strong>Posted on December 27, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>Attention CycloneWare users: On January 11th, 2025, development will temporarily cease for a few hours. This brief pause is not permanent—our team will be taking a short break as the owner has decided to watch <em>Strange World</em>, which will air on Disney Channel at 3:15 PM local time (6:15 PM EST).</p>
            <p>We want to emphasize that this is just a temporary pause, and development will resume shortly after the movie ends. Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to continuing our work on CycloneWare once the movie concludes!</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for updates, and we appreciate your support!</p>
