            <h2>Looking to the Future of CycloneWare</h2>
            <p><strong>Posted on December 26, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>In the near future, CycloneWare will have some exciting new features! We are working on Cyclone Life, a life simulation game, and Cyclone Social, a social media platform. While we’ve tried to create these features before, we encountered many bugs and confusion. But we’re not giving up! This time, we won’t delete our repository on GitHub, and we’re pushing forward to make these projects a reality.</p>
